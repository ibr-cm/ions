# Insight on Network Simulations (IoNS)

IoNS is a tool for generating plots from large amounts of data for evaluation purposes with the help [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).

Orignally, it was developed for evaluating results generated by with [Artery](http://artery.v2x-research.eu/). 
IoNS can also be used for processing results generated by other simulations frameworks based on [OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org/), as it supports its SQLite database format used for result recording.
However, it can be used to process databases from all sorts of sources, be it ns-3 or real-world experiements.

# General Instructions

This page provides a detailed description on how to setup the evaluation and plotting tool for analyzing simulation results.
The installation instructions assume a Linux OS of the Debian/Ubuntu variety, 

# How to get started
## Setup

### Clone this repository  
`git clone https://github.com/ibr-cm/ions.git`

### Install the dependencies

The dependencies for this toolkit can be managed with either [pipenv](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/), [pdm](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/) or [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).
Or any other package manager that can import the requirement manifest of those tools (see [tool recommendations](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/tool-recommendations/))

#### Install the package manager

This step depends on the operating system and the chosen package manager.

First, change the `PYTHON_VENV_MANAGER` variable in `config.sh` to the package
manager of your choice and the `PYTHON_VENV_MANAGER_RUN_CMD` to the command of
the manager that allows for running arbitrary commands within the virtual
environment, e.g. `run` for pipenv and pdm or an empty string for pip.

Install `pipenv` for your user to ~/.local (see [install instructions](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/install/#pragmatic-installation-of-pipenv)):  
`pip3 install --user pipenv`
For [pdm](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/#other-installation-methods):
`pip3 install --user pdm`

For easier access to the binaries installed by pip, add `~/.local/bin` to the PATH environment variable (possibly add this to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):  
`export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin`

#### Install the dependencies using pipenv
Install dependencies from `Pipfile.lock` to a virtualenv in `~/.local/share`:  
`pipenv install --ignore-pipfile`  
This install the last versions known to be good.  
If you prefer to install the latest versions (possibly incompatible or unsafe & untrusted; installing from `Pipfile.lock` checks the hashes of the installed packages), run:  
`pipenv install`  
If you prefer to install the packages into the project directory, set the `PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT` environment variable to `1`, see [virtualenv mapping caveat](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/install/#virtualenv-mapping-caveat).  

#### Install the dependencies using pdm

If you want to install the versions specified in the lock file:
`pdm sync`
Or install the latest versions instead, with the already mentioned caveats:
`pdm install`

#### Install the dependencies using pip

If you want to install the versions specified in the lock file:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
