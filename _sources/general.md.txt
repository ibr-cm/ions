# Insight on Network Simulations (IoNS)

IoNS is a tool for generating plots from large amounts of data for evaluation purposes with the help [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [dask](https://www.dask.org/).

Originally, it was developed for evaluating results generated with [Artery](http://artery.v2x-research.eu/). 
However, IoNS can also be used for processing results generated by other simulations frameworks based on [OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org/), as it supports its SQLite database format used for result recording.
Further, it can be used to process databases from all sorts of sources, be it ns-3 or real-world experiments.

IoNS main benefits are:
 * Describing plots and their generation from data sources as recipes in YAML
 * Two-staged plot generation:
    * Evaluation: preprocessing and storing data as [feather](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/feather.html) files
    * Plot: generation of plots from preprocessed feather files
 * Parallel data processing with [dask](https://www.dask.org/) and SLURM support

Key concepts, installation instructions and further guidance can be found in the [documentation](https://ibr-cm.github.io/ions/).
